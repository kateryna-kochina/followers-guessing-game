# Instagram Followers Guessing Game

A simple guessing game based on the number of followers on Instagram. 


## Here's how the game works:

* The script imports necessary modules like os for clearing the terminal screen, random for generating random numbers, and art for displaying ASCII art.
* The game data is imported from a module called game_data.
* Two random persons are generated from the data, and their names and descriptions are displayed to the player.
* The player is asked to guess which of the two persons has a higher number of Instagram followers.
* If the player's guess is correct, their score is incremented by 1, and a new pair of persons is generated for the next round.
* If the player's guess is incorrect, the game ends, and the final score is displayed along with a message indicating the correct answer.
* The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess.
